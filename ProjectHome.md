This project is intended to make an automated web wrapper. It basically crawls a particular web site, lists all the URL's within that domain, and clusters them. Within each cluster, template extraction will be done by finding common parts of the pages. Our aim is to identify parts of the HTML page i.e. main content block, header, footer and repeated patterns, if possible. Identifying these parts will be useful for web crawlers. It also makes page classification and clustering more accurate since the noise will be reduced.
